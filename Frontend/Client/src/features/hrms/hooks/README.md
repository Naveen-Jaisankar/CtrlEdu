This folder is for custom hooks specific to this feature. Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic related to the hrms functionality. Examples might include:
Data Fetching: Hooks to fetch staff records, payroll data, or employee profiles from the backend.
State Management: Hooks to manage local state for components, such as form inputs, filters, or pagination.
Side Effects: Hooks to handle side effects, like triggering alerts or loading spinners when an action is performed.
Naming hooks based on functionality (e.g., usePayrollData, useEmployeeRecords) is recommended, making them easier to identify and import.
